# Laptop Price Predictor
This is a project that aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various factors such as brand, processor, storage, and graphics card. The project uses a machine learning algorithm to make predictions and is built using the Streamlit library in Python.

# Requirements
To run the project, the following packages are required:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
sklearn
# Data
The data used in this project was obtained from a Kaggle dataset and contains information on over 1000 laptops from various brands and specifications. The data includes information on the following features:

Brand
Processor
Storage
Graphics card
Price
# Analysis
The data was preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical variables into numerical variables. A Random Forest Regressor model was trained on the data and was used to make predictions on the prices of laptops based on the input features.

# Deployment
The project can be deployed as a web application using Streamlit. The app allows the user to input the specifications of a laptop and predicts its price based on the machine learning model.

# Conclusion
The model achieved a good accuracy in predicting the prices of laptops based on their specifications. The web application makes it easy for users to obtain price predictions and is a useful tool for anyone looking to buy a laptop.
